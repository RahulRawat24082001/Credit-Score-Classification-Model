# Credit-Score-Classification-Model

## Overview : 
This project focuses on building a credit score classification model using the Random Forest Classifier. The objective is to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on various financial and demographic features.Credit scoring is a crucial aspect for financial institutions as it helps in assessing the risk associated with lending to a particular individual.

## Features
1. Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
2. Data: A dataset containing financial and demographic features (e.g., income, debt, age, employment status)
3. Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
4. Tools & Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly
